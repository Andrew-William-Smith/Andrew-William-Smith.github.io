This is a summary of the formulas covered in my Honours Geometry class.  For each formula, I have given the formula itself, what it can help you calculate, and what values you must have to effectively use the formula.

### Midpoint formula
**Given:** Two colinear points\\
**Find:** The point equidistant from the two points (midpoint)\\
**Formula:** $$\left(\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\ \tfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$, where <span class="vardef">$$\left(x_1, y_1\right)$$ and $$\left(x_2, y_2\right)$$ are colinear points</span>.

### Slope formula
**Given:** Two colinear points\\
**Find:** The slope formed by the line through the two points\\
**Formula:** $$\tfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$, where <span class="vardef">$$\left(x_1, y_1\right)$$ and $$\left(x_2, y_2\right)$$ are colinear points</span>.

### Point-slope form
**Given:** The slope of a line and a point on the line\\
**Find:** The equation of the line\\
**Formula:** $$y-y_1=m\left(x-x_1\right)$$, where <span class="vardef">$$\left(x_1, y_1\right)$$ is a point on a line</span> and <span class="vardef">$$m$$ = the slope of the line</span>.

### Slope-intercept form
**Given:** The slope of a line and its *y*-intercept\\
**Find:** The equation of the line\\
**Formula:** $$y=mx+b$$, where <span class="vardef">$$m$$ = the slope of the line</span> and <span class="vardef">$$b$$ = its *y*-intercept</span>.

### Distance formula
**Given:** Two colinear points\\
**Find:** The length of the segment between the two points\\
**Formula:** $$\sqrt{\left(x_2-x_1\right)^2+\left(y_2-y_1\right)^2}$$, where <span class="vardef">$$\left(x_1, y_1\right)$$ and $$\left(x_2, y_2\right)$$ are colinear points</span>.

### Sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon
**Given:** The number of sides of a polygon\\
**Find:** The sum of the measures of the interior angles of the polygon\\
**Formula:** $$\left(n-2\right)180^{\text{o}}$$, where <span class="vardef">$$n$$ = number of sides</span>.

### Measure of an external angle of a regular polygon
**Given:** The number of sides of a regular polygon\\
**Find:** The measure of an external angle of the polygon\\
**Formula:** $$\tfrac{360^{\text{o}}}{n}$$, where <span class="vardef">$$n$$ = number of sides</span>.
