On this blog, I use a formatting style that I have designed to be as readable as possible.  The meaning of any component should be quite apparent by just looking at it, but, if you do not find this to be true, see the list below for a complete list of styles:

- Normal text.  It looks like, well text.  There's nothing special about its formatting; the text itself is what's special.
- Normal keybindings.  Individual keys in a keystroke are formatted to look like keys on a keyboard.  For example, pressing <span class="key">Cmd</span>+<span class="key">Shift</span>+<span class="key">P</span> will open a new Private Window in Firefox on OS X.
- Menus.  Menus in a GUI are represented by elements that are formatted to look like the menus themselves.  For example, in Firefox, clicking <span class="menu-seq"><span class="gui-menu">Tools</span><span class="gui-link">▸</span><span class="gui-menu">Web Developer</span><span class="gui-link">▸</span><span class="gui-menu">Toggle Tools</span></span> (<span class="key">Cmd</span>+<span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">I</span>) will open or close Firefox's Developer Tools, depending on whether or not they are already open.
- `Code expressions` and simple mathematical expressions are surrounded by tortoiseshell brackets and typeset in a fixed-width font, as that's what most programmers (myself included) use in their editors.  Blocks of code are displayed with syntax highlighting to make them more readable.
- Variables in code explanations are surrounded by arrow brackets.  For example, <span class="vardef"><span class="var">x</span> = angle measure</span> in the expression <code>sin(x)</code>.
